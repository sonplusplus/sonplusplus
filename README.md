### üõçÔ∏è [Front-Ecommerce](https://github.com/sonplusplus/Front-Ecommerce)
A modern and scalable front-end implementation for an e-commerce platform, built with a focus on user experience and component-based architecture.

This project demonstrates the ability to build clean, responsive, and interactive user interfaces for a web-based application. It serves as the client-facing side of an online store, featuring components for product Browse, searching, and viewing detailed product information. The application was developed using a component-based architecture, which makes the codebase modular, reusable, and easy to maintain‚Äîessential skills for building large-scale web applications.

#### Highlights
* **Responsive User Interface**: The UI is designed to provide a seamless experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
* **Component-Based Architecture**: Built using a modular approach, where the UI is broken down into independent and reusable components (e.g., product cards, navigation bar, search field). This promotes scalability and maintainability.
* **State Management**: Showcases proficiency in managing application state to handle user interactions, shopping cart data, and dynamic content rendering.

#### Tech Stack
* **ReactJS**
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **HTML5 & CSS3**

### üé¨ [Cinema-DDB-Front](https://github.com/sonplusplus/Cinema-DDB-Front)
An interactive front-end application for a cinema ticket booking system, designed to handle complex user interactions and state management.

This project is the front-end for a movie theater booking platform, allowing users to browse movies, view showtimes, and select their seats through an interactive seating map. The application is a practical demonstration of managing complex UI states, such as tracking selected seats, showtimes, and user choices, which is a critical skill in building sophisticated single-page applications (SPAs).

#### Highlights
* **Interactive UI/UX**: Features a dynamic and engaging interface that allows users to easily navigate through the booking process, from movie selection to seat reservation.
* **Complex State Management**: Demonstrates expertise in managing intricate application states, ensuring data consistency across multiple components (e.g., updating the total price as seats are selected).
* **Component Reusability**: The UI is built with reusable components for movie listings, showtime displays, and seating charts, showcasing efficient and scalable development practices.

#### Tech Stack
* **ReactJS**
* **JavaScript**
* **CSS**

### ü§ñ [Chatbot-ecommerce-callapi](https://github.com/sonplusplus/Chatbot-ecommerce-callapi)
An intelligent e-commerce chatbot capable of real-time interactions by fetching live data from external APIs.

This project elevates a standard chatbot by giving it the ability to perform actions and provide real-time, dynamic information. The chatbot can handle user queries about order status, product availability, or shipping details by making live calls to a backend API. This demonstrates the ability to integrate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system with external services, bridging the gap between conversational AI and a live business application.

#### Highlights
* **API Integration**: The chatbot connects to external REST APIs to fetch or update data, providing users with up-to-the-minute information.
* **Actionable Conversations**: Moves beyond simple Q&A by executing tasks on behalf of the user, such as retrieving specific order details from a database.
* **Backend System Interaction**: Showcases skills in building a bridge between an NLP model and a live backend, a crucial component of modern, service-oriented AI applications.

#### Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **Rasa / NLTK** (or similar NLP framework)
* **REST APIs**

### üí¨ [Chatbot-ecommerce](https://github.com/sonplusplus/Chatbot-ecommerce)
A foundational NLP-based chatbot designed to handle customer service inquiries for an e-commerce platform.

This project demonstrates core skills in Natural Language Processing and machine learning by building a chatbot from the ground up. The model is trained on custom e-commerce data (intents, entities, and responses) to understand user queries related to products, orders, and customer support. It serves as the foundational AI engine for a conversational agent, showcasing the process of data preparation, model training, and intent recognition.

#### Highlights
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Demonstrates core skills in text processing, intent classification, and entity extraction to understand user requests.
* **Custom Model Training**: The chatbot is trained on a domain-specific dataset, showcasing the ability to tailor an AI model to a particular business need (e-commerce).
* **Conversational Flow Design**: The project involves designing conversation patterns and responses, which is a key aspect of creating an effective and user-friendly chatbot.

#### Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **NLP Libraries** (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)

### üöÄ [Pacman_DDQN](https://github.com/sonplusplus/Pacman_DDQN)
An AI agent that learns to play Pacman by applying a sophisticated Reinforcement Learning algorithm to raw visual data.

This project implements a **Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)**, an advanced model designed to solve complex, high-dimensional environments. The agent processes raw game pixels through a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, enabling it to learn optimal gameplay strategies‚Äîsuch as navigating mazes, collecting fruits, and avoiding ghosts‚Äîentirely through trial and error.

#### Highlights
* **Decoupled Q-Networks**: Implements the core of DDQN by using 2 networks **Q-policy** and **Q-target** to select the best action and evaluate that action's value. This decoupling mitigates the overestimation bias found in standard Q-learning.
* **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**: Instead of uniform sampling, the agent learns more efficiently by replaying important experiences more frequently, focusing on events where there is a large discrepancy between its predicted and actual Q-values.
* **End-to-End Visual Learning**: The agent learns directly from pixel data via a 3 layer CNN, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering and showcasing skills in building vision-based learning systems.

#### Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **TensorFlow**
* **OpenAI Gym**
