## üöÄ Projects

### üõçÔ∏è [Front-Ecommerce](https://github.com/sonplusplus/Front-Ecommerce)
A modern and scalable front-end implementation for an e-commerce platform, built with a focus on user experience and component-based architecture.

This project demonstrates the ability to build clean, responsive, and interactive user interfaces for a web-based application. It serves as the client-facing side of an online store, featuring components for product Browse, searching, and viewing detailed product information. The application was developed using a component-based architecture, which makes the codebase modular, reusable, and easy to maintain‚Äîessential skills for building large-scale web applications.

#### Highlights
* **Responsive User Interface**: The UI is designed to provide a seamless experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
* **Component-Based Architecture**: Built using a modular approach, where the UI is broken down into independent and reusable components (e.g., product cards, navigation bar, search field). This promotes scalability and maintainability.
* **State Management**: Showcases proficiency in managing application state to handle user interactions, shopping cart data, and dynamic content rendering.

#### Tech Stack
* **ReactJS**
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **HTML5 & CSS3**

### üé¨ [Cinema-DDB-Front](https://github.com/sonplusplus/Cinema-DDB-Front)
An interactive front-end application for a cinema ticket booking system, designed to handle complex user interactions and state management.

This project is the front-end for a movie theater booking platform, allowing users to browse movies, view showtimes, and select their seats through an interactive seating map. The application is a practical demonstration of managing complex UI states, such as tracking selected seats, showtimes, and user choices, which is a critical skill in building sophisticated single-page applications (SPAs).

#### Highlights
* **Interactive UI/UX**: Features a dynamic and engaging interface that allows users to easily navigate through the booking process, from movie selection to seat reservation.
* **Complex State Management**: Demonstrates expertise in managing intricate application states, ensuring data consistency across multiple components (e.g., updating the total price as seats are selected).
* **Component Reusability**: The UI is built with reusable components for movie listings, showtime displays, and seating charts, showcasing efficient and scalable development practices.

#### Tech Stack
* **ReactJS**
* **JavaScript**
* **CSS**

### ü§ñ [Intelligent E-commerce Chatbot](https://github.com/sonplusplus/Chatbot-ecommerce)
A sophisticated, AI-powered conversational assistant built with the Rasa framework, designed to serve as a virtual shopping assistant for an online electronics store. This chatbot enhances the customer experience by providing instant, real-time support in Vietnamese, handling a wide range of queries from product discovery.

#### Highlights
* **Dynamic Product Interaction**: The chatbot can recommend products based on type, price, and features. It can also filter search results by brand and price range, and even provide side-by-side comparisons of two different products.
* **Real-Time API Integration**: Using custom actions, the chatbot connects to the store's backend to check real-time product prices, stock availability, and order status, providing users with up-to-the-minute information.
* **Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Built with a robust NLU pipeline, the chatbot accurately identifies user intents (e.g., `ask_product_recommendation`, `compare_products`) and extracts key entities like `product_name`, `brand`, and `price_range` from Vietnamese text.

#### Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **Rasa**
* **Rasa SDK**
* **REST APIs**
* **Pandas & Requests**

### ü§ñ [Chatbot E-commerce Call API](https://github.com/sonplusplus/chatbot-ecommerce-callapi)
A Flask-based backend service designed to power a conversational AI chatbot. This project connects to Google's powerful Gemini-1.5-flash model to understand and respond to user queries in real-time, serving as the core intelligence for an e-commerce virtual assistant.

#### Highlights
* **RESTful API Backend**: Built with Flask, providing a clean `/api/chat` endpoint for seamless integration with any front-end application.
* **Google Gemini Integration**: Leverages the `google-generativeai` SDK to harness the power of the Gemini-1.5 Flash model for advanced natural language understanding and generation.
* **Context-Aware Conversations**: Intelligently processes and passes conversation history to the AI model, enabling more natural, stateful interactions.
* **Secure and Configurable**: Manages API keys securely using environment variables and includes built-in safety settings to moderate content.

#### Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **Flask**
* **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**

### üöÄ [Pacman_DDQN](https://github.com/sonplusplus/Pacman_DDQN)
An AI agent that learns to play Pacman by applying a sophisticated Reinforcement Learning algorithm to raw visual data.

This project implements a **Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)**, an advanced model designed to solve complex, high-dimensional environments. The agent processes raw game pixels through a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, enabling it to learn optimal gameplay strategies‚Äîsuch as navigating mazes, collecting fruits, and avoiding ghosts‚Äîentirely through trial and error.

#### Highlights
* **Decoupled Q-Networks**: Implements the core of DDQN by using 2 networks **Q-policy** and **Q-target** to select the best action and evaluate that action's value. This decoupling mitigates the overestimation bias found in standard Q-learning.
* **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**: Instead of uniform sampling, the agent learns more efficiently by replaying important experiences more frequently, focusing on events where there is a large discrepancy between its predicted and actual Q-values.
* **End-to-End Visual Learning**: The agent learns directly from pixel data via a 3 layer CNN, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering and showcasing skills in building vision-based learning systems.

#### Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **TensorFlow**
* **OpenAI Gym**
